In this repository, I will show analysis applied with the **Google Merchandise Store account** that contains historical data that will allow us interesting analysis. It is divided into 2 parts:

# Part I: Acquisition Report
 It is found when using the demo account. **Note:** It is limited because we do not have editing permissions.

### The number of sessions or visits per marketing channel:

The 2 main traffic sources are **Direct** and **Organic Search.**

- **Direct** is when the user writes directly in the browser shop.googlemerchandisestore.com
- **Organic Search** is when you search on the Google engine and click on the result (without being Sponsored or Advertised)

_How do I know if this is a normal thing to happen?
That is, do the numbers make sense within Google article sales?_

_To compare whether this is normal in the industry, let's think about another merchandising business._

We can compare the Disney Store in **Similar Web**

As we can see, Direct and Organic Search from Disney are kind of the same as in Google Merch Store in Acquisition. Let's go back to Google Merch:

Now if we add a new second group arrangement, we can check the referral link for that particular traffic source:

Most of the referral could be blogs or article related to mobile phones or the very Google products:
